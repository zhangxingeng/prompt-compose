 * Self-update — the reactive state behind the update banner and the footer's
 * update affordance.
 *
 * Checks GitHub Releases for a newer signed build and installs it in-app. This
 * is one of the app's two network requests — the other is the optional embedding
 * model (`src-tauri/src/prompts/embed.rs`) — and like that one it only ever
 * fetches. Any failure (offline, GitHub unreachable, no release yet) is
 * swallowed on the launch-time path so it can never block the app from starting.
 *
 * **The banner tells you once; the footer always knows.** A version surfaces the
 * banner at most once per install, ever — see `markSeen` below for why that is
 * recorded on *render* rather than on a click. The footer
 * (`src/routes/+page.svelte`) is the permanent quiet channel that keeps a
 * dismissed-or-missed update reachable forever.
 *
 * The `@tauri-apps/*` imports are static but import-safe: they only touch the
 * Tauri IPC bridge when their functions are actually called, and every caller
 * guards on `isTauri()` first (this app's convention is a guard at each call
 * site, not one centralized wrapper).
